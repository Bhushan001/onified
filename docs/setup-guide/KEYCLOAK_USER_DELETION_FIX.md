# Keycloak User Deletion Fix

## Problem Description

Previously, when deleting a user from the Onified platform through the User Management Service, the user was only deleted from the application's database but remained in Keycloak. This created an inconsistency where:

1. Users could no longer log in through the application (since they were deleted from the database)
2. But they still existed in Keycloak and could potentially be used for authentication
3. This could lead to security issues and data inconsistency

## Root Cause

The issue was in the user deletion flow:

1. **User Creation**: When a user was created via the Authentication Service, it was created in both:
   - User Management Service database
   - Keycloak (via `KeycloakUserService.createUserInKeycloak()`)

2. **User Deletion**: When a user was deleted via the User Management Service, it was only deleted from:
   - User Management Service database
   - **Missing**: Keycloak deletion

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced KeycloakUserService

Added two new methods to `authentication-service/src/main/java/com/onified/ai/authentication_service/service/KeycloakUserService.java`:

```java
/**
 * Delete a user from Keycloak by username
 */
public boolean deleteUserFromKeycloak(String username)

/**
 * Delete a user from Keycloak by Keycloak user ID
 */
public boolean deleteUserFromKeycloakById(String keycloakUserId)
```

### 2. New Authentication Service Endpoint

Added a new endpoint in `authentication-service/src/main/java/com/onified/ai/authentication_service/controller/AuthController.java`:

```java
@DeleteMapping("/keycloak/user/{username}")
public ResponseEntity<ApiResponse<String>> deleteUserFromKeycloak(@PathVariable String username)
```

This endpoint allows the User Management Service to request Keycloak user deletion.

### 3. AuthenticationFeignClient

Created a new Feign client in `user-management-service/src/main/java/com/onified/ai/ums/client/AuthenticationFeignClient.java`:

```java
@FeignClient(name = "authentication-service", url = "${feign.client.config.authentication-service.url}")
public interface AuthenticationFeignClient {
    @DeleteMapping("/api/auth/keycloak/user/{username}")
    ApiResponse<String> deleteUserFromKeycloak(@PathVariable("username") String username);
}
```

### 4. Updated UserService.deleteUser()

Modified `user-management-service/src/main/java/com/onified/ai/ums/service/UserService.java`:

```java
@Transactional
public void deleteUser(UUID id) {
    User user = userRepository.findById(id)
            .orElseThrow(() -> new UserNotFoundException(String.format(ErrorConstants.USER_NOT_FOUND, id)));
    
    String username = user.getUsername();
    
    // Delete from database first
    userRepository.deleteById(id);
    
    // Delete from Keycloak (non-blocking)
    try {
        ApiResponse<String> response = authenticationFeignClient.deleteUserFromKeycloak(username);
        if (response != null && response.getStatusCode() == HttpStatus.OK.value()) {
            System.out.println("Successfully deleted user '" + username + "' from Keycloak");
        } else {
            System.err.println("Failed to delete user '" + username + "' from Keycloak. Response: " + response);
        }
    } catch (Exception e) {
        System.err.println("Warning: Failed to delete user '" + username + "' from Keycloak: " + e.getMessage());
        // Don't throw exception here - user is already deleted from database
        // This ensures database consistency even if Keycloak deletion fails
    }
}
```

### 5. Configuration Updates

#### User Management Service Configuration

Updated `user-management-service/src/main/resources/application.yml`:

```yaml
feign:
  client:
    config:
      authentication-service:
        url: ${AUTHENTICATION_SERVICE_URL:http://localhost:9083}
```

#### Docker Compose Configuration

Updated `docker-compose.yml` for the user-management-service:

```yaml
environment:
  AUTHENTICATION_SERVICE_URL: http://authentication-service:9083
depends_on:
  authentication-service:
    condition: service_healthy
```

#### Environment Variables

Added to `env.example`:

```bash
AUTHENTICATION_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:9083
```

## How It Works

### User Deletion Flow

1. **User Management Service** receives a DELETE request for a user
2. **UserService.deleteUser()** is called with the user ID
3. **Database Deletion**: User is deleted from the User Management Service database
4. **Keycloak Deletion**: A call is made to the Authentication Service to delete the user from Keycloak
5. **Authentication Service** uses the Keycloak Admin Client to delete the user from Keycloak
6. **Response**: Success/failure is logged but doesn't affect the database deletion

### Error Handling

- **Non-blocking**: Keycloak deletion failures don't prevent database deletion
- **Logging**: All Keycloak deletion attempts are logged for monitoring
- **Graceful degradation**: If Keycloak is unavailable, users are still deleted from the database

## Testing

### Manual Testing

Use the provided Postman collection: `postman/user-management-service/Keycloak_User_Deletion_Test.postman_collection.json`

### Test Steps

1. Create a user via Authentication Service (creates in both DB and Keycloak)
2. Verify user exists in both systems
3. Delete user via User Management Service
4. Verify user is deleted from both systems

### Expected Results

- User deletion from User Management Service should delete from both database and Keycloak
- If Keycloak deletion fails, user should still be deleted from database
- All operations should be logged for monitoring

## Monitoring

### Logs to Monitor

1. **User Management Service logs**:
   - `Successfully deleted user 'username' from Keycloak`
   - `Warning: Failed to delete user 'username' from Keycloak: error_message`

2. **Authentication Service logs**:
   - `Successfully deleted user 'username' from Keycloak`
   - `Failed to delete user 'username' from Keycloak. Status: status_code`

### Health Checks

- Monitor the `/actuator/health` endpoints of both services
- Check Keycloak connectivity through the authentication service

## Security Considerations

1. **Admin Access**: The Authentication Service uses Keycloak admin credentials to delete users
2. **Audit Trail**: All deletion operations are logged
3. **Database Consistency**: Database deletion is prioritized over Keycloak deletion
4. **Error Handling**: Failed Keycloak deletions don't rollback database deletions

## Future Improvements

1. **Synchronous Deletion**: Consider making Keycloak deletion synchronous for critical users
2. **Retry Mechanism**: Implement retry logic for failed Keycloak deletions
3. **Event-Driven**: Use event-driven architecture for better decoupling
4. **Bulk Operations**: Support bulk user deletion operations
5. **Soft Delete**: Consider implementing soft delete for audit purposes
